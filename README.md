The Gaming Room had a successful game that they wanted to move to a mobile app. I think I went over their options appropriately and gave them the best solution for their budget. However, I would probably want to know their exact budget and the reasoning they trust a junior developer with such an important task. When working through the code I felt having the astarter code really helped. It would have taken me a lot longer to get to a completed project without it. If I could change one thing about my work it would be on the developing platform as codio never works properly no matter what device I try to use it on. Considering the clients needs always needs to be taken into account, you need to know what they want and how the end user is going to be using the software before you design anything. The clients budget as well helps you to know what you have and a timeframe of when it needs to be done. I approached designing the software one step at a time and one application at a time taking it step by step to meet the clients demands helped me stay organized and I personally felt that helped me a ton throughout develpoment!
